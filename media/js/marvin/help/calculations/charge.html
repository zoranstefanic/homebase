		Chemical bonds between atoms within a molecule consist of one or more
		electron pairs distributed among the connected atoms. Bonding
		electrons are not equally distributed among the atoms having different
		electronegativity.

				<td>In this case we can speak about partial charge of atoms. We will give the

				<td>In the intermediate state the nuclear distance of A and B

		clouds is polarized to a different degree. Although the electrons of
		both A and B have partially moved outside of the control volume, this
		effect is greater in atom B being the more polarizable atom. The more
		polarizable an atom, the more electrons will flow out of its control
		volume so that the atom will become more positive relative to its
		initial state.</td>

		molecule is measured as a charge flow out of or into the atom's

	<h2><a id="Concept of Orbital Electronegativity"></a>Concept of orbital	electronegativity</h2>
	<p>
	Partial charge distribution of the molecule is governed by the orbital
	electronegativity of the atoms contained in the molecule.
	<br>The definition of orbital electronegativity of atoms in
	molecules was first given by <a href="#ref1">Mulliken <sup>1</sup></a> by the following equation:
	</p>
	<p>
		<font face="times new roman">&chi;<sub>&nu;</sub> = 0.5*(<em>I</em><sub>&nu;</sub>+<em>E</em><sub>&nu;</sub>)</font>
	<!--<img src="charge_files/Mulliken_EN.png" width="143" height="28" alt="Mulliken" />-->
	</p>
	<p>
	Where:
	<ul>
		<li><font face="times new roman">&chi;<sub>&nu;</sub></font><!--<img src="charge_files/EN_char.png" height="15" width="18" alt="Xv" />--> is the orbital 
		electronegativity of the atom;</li>
		<li><em>I</em><sub><font face="times new roman">&nu;</font></sub> is the ionization potential of the atom;</li>
		<li><em>E</em><sub><font face="times new roman">&nu;</font></sub> is the electron affinity of the atom.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>The orbital electronegativity of the molecule depends on the	hybrid state and partial charge 
	of the atoms; see references <a href="#ref2">2</a> and <a href="#ref2">3</a>. Electronegativity 
	is a quadratic function of partial charge given by the following equation:
	</p>
	<p>
	<font face="times new roman">&chi;<sub>&nu;</sub></font> = <em>a</em>+<em>b</em><em>q</em>+<em>c</em><em>q</em><sup>2</sup>
	<!--<img src="charge_files/Quad_EN.png" width="135" height="37" alt="quad" />-->
	</p>
	<p>Where:
		<ul>
			<li><em>q</em> is the partial charge on the atom;
			<li><em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> are coefficients determined from 
			<em>I</em><sub><font face="times new roman">&nu;</font></sub> and <em>E</em><sub><font face="times new roman">&nu;</font></sub>.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Orbital electronegativity, and subsequently <a href="#ref4">partial charge <sup>4</sup></a> 
	distribution of any	molecule is calculated iteratively.</p>

	<p>
		In benzene every carbon atom has the same electronegativity. This is
		why the partial charge distribution is identical among the carbon
		atoms. The total partial charge of the hydrogen atoms has the same
		magnitude with opposite sign. The <font face="times new roman">&pi;</font>
		partial charge is zero for all atoms of benzene. In our model, the
		total charge is composed of two independent components - the pi and
		sigma partial charges, which are determined by the pi and sigma bonds,
		respectively.

	<h3><a id="Example_2"></a>Example 2</h3>
	<p>
		In ring substituted benzene, the partial charge distribution
		helps to predict the reactivity of the carbon atoms that are members
		of the ring. If the substitute is electron-donating, the partial
		charge increases in the <em>ortho</em> and <em>para</em> positions of the aromatic ring.
		If the substitute is electron-withdrawing, partial charge decreases in
		the <em>ortho</em> and <em>para</em> positions.

		The effects of substitution in five membered aromatic rings can
		also be described with resonance structures:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="charge_files/FM_ring.png" width="335" height="237" alt="FM_ring" /></td>
			<td>All of these resonance structures contribute to the resulting
		partial charge distribution. Here X represents any heteroatom and Y is
		any electron-withdrawing substituent. Resonance structures reveal that
		positive partial charge will be increased at the positions 1, 3 and 5.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</p>
	<p>
	Let Y stand for a methoxycarbonyl group and let X represent nitrogen.
	The calculated partial charge distributions of methyl
	1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylate and pyrrole are given below. The size of each
	red spot represents the accumulated excess positive charge. From
	resonance structures we would expect positive partial charge to
	increase at positions 1, 3 and 5. This expected distribution agrees
	with the calculated ones.

	<h3><a id="Example_4"></a>Example 4</h3>
	<p>Hydrocarbons usually have weak acidic character. Carbon atoms have different 
				partial charges and ability to delocalize excess negative charge after the loss of a 
				proton. The more positive partial charge accumulated on the carbon atom, the more 
				acidic its character.
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="charge_files/CH.png" alt="" /></td>
				<td>From partial charge calculations, we find that all the carbon atoms	have negative 
				partial charge except for the one indicated by a red arrow. The most acidic carbon 
				atom at the tip of red arrow has partial charge of +0.0285 electron unit. This result 
				agrees with the published result, see <a href="#ref5">reference 5</a>.</td>
