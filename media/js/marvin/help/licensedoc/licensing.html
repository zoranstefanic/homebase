<h2>About ChemAxon Licensing</h2>

<p>
A ChemAxon software license grants you the legal right to use a piece of ChemAxon software. 
For each software program you use, you need a license, 
which is granted to you and documented in the license agreement. 
</p>
<p>
ChemAxon has recently introduced its new license generation system, 
which will document all relevant information describing the license 
purchased in a comprehensive and easily handlable form.
</p>
<p>
The license file should be installed using the ChemAxon License Manager.<br> 
Further details can be found at the <a href="licenseFAQ.html">Frequently asked questions</a> section.
