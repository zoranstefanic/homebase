<h3> Building of  Superatom S-group </h3> 
We show how to build Superatom S-groups in the example of the phenil group.<br> 
<img src="images/sgroup1.png" width=15% alt="superatom sgroup"> 

<h4> Creating of SuperatomSgroup object </h4>
<p> 
 First, the whole molecule should be built using the Core API methods, or 
imported. In this example, we import it from SMILES format. 
Then the SuperatomSgroup is constructed with the molecule in the argument of
the constructor.
</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
        Molecule mol = MolImporter.importMol("C1=CC=CC=C1C");
        Cleaner.clean(mol, 2, null);

        // Create the Sgroups.
        SuperatomSgroup superSg = new SuperatomSgroup(mol);
</pre>

<h4> Setting an S-group as the parent of its atoms  </h4>
<p>
The atoms that are supposed to be a part of an S-group should be added to it 
(that is, set the S-group as the parent of the MolAtom).
In our example, we add the carbon atoms of the benzene ring to the S-group,
they are the first six atoms of the molecule.
</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) {
            mol.setSgroupParent(mol.getAtom(i), superSg, true);
        }
</pre>
In the argument of the <code>Molecule.setSgroupParent()</code> method,
<code>MolAtom</code> represents the atom to be added to the 
Superatom S-group <code> superSg</code>. If the value of the boolean parameter 
is true, the atom will be added to the S-group,
otherwise it will be removed from there.

<h4> Set subscript of the S-group  </h4>
<p> 
 In order to set subscript of a Superatom S-group, use the 
<code> SuperatomSgroup.setSubscript(String)</code> method:
</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
       superSg.setSubscript("Ph"); 
</pre>

<h4> Adding attachment points </h4>
<p> Since Marvin 6.0, we support to add S-group attachment point only to atoms
that are part of a Superatom S-group. 
Attachment points are represented by an object which stores its attach atom, 
crossing bond and order. 
The attach atom is one of the <code>MolAtom</code>s of the superatom S-group 
on which the attachment point is placed.
The crossing bond is a bond where </p>
<ul>
 	<li> one of the end atoms is inside the Superatom S-group (this atom is called
 attach atom); </li>
 	<li> the other end atom is outside the Superatom S-group.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When an attachment point is free, the crossing bond is null, further crossing
bond addition is possible.
The order is an integer greater than zero defining the priority of the 
attachment point. When a bond is added to a contracted superatom S-group, 
it occupies a free attachment point with the lowest order.
</p>
<p>  
To add an attachment point, use one of the following methods:  
</p>
<ul>
   <li> <code>SuperatomSgroup.addAttachmentPoint(MolAtom); </code>
   <li> <code>SuperatomSgroup.addAttachmentPoint(MolAtom, int order); </code>
</ul>
<p> In the first case, the smallest unused number is set as order.</p>
<p>Crossing bond can be added to an attachment point by invoking 
<code>SuperatomSgroup.addCrossingBond(MolAtom attachAtom, MolBond crossingBond)</code> 
method. However, the crossing bond information is updated automatically by 
<code>Molecule.add(MolBond bond)</code> method. </p>

<p> Note, that the method <code>MolAtom.setAttach(int)</code> is deprecated,
and its usage is not recommended any more. 
</p>

<h4> Calculate the attachment points </h4> 
<p>
By invoking <code>SuperatomSgroup.calculateAttachmentPoints()</code>, 
attachments points are put to atoms in the superatom S-group that have bond 
which other end atom is outside the group (crossing bond). 
It is useful when the superatom S-group is created using the 
<code>SuperatomSgroup.setSgroupGraph()</code> method.
</p>

<h4> Getting the attachment point information</h4>
<p> Attachment point information of a superatom S-group 
can be received by calling method <code>SuperatomSgroup.getAttachmentPoints()</code>. 
The result is an <code>java.util.ArrayList</code> of <code>AttachmentPoint</code>
objects from the superatom S-group. The list is sorted by increasing attachment point orders. 
</p>
<p> Note, that the method <code>MolAtom.getAttach()</code> is deprecated,
and its usage is not recommended any more. The orders of the attachment points
located on a given atom can be obtained by invoking method
<code>SuperatomSgroup.getAttachmentPointOrders(MolAtom)</code>.
It returns the <code>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</code> of attachment point orders
located on the given <code>MolAtom</code>.
</p>

<h4>Leaving group</h4>
<p> 
A leaving group atom can be defined to each attachment point. 
That atom is in the molecule when the attachment point is free 
and disappear when a crossing bond is bound to that attachment point 
("leaves the molecule").
</p>
<img src="images/sgroup_lgrp.png" alt="Alanine with its leaving group">	
<p> 
In the example above the leaving groups on the N-terminal of Alanine, on the
C-terminal of Cystein as well as on its Sufur atom is visible. 
Due to the bond between the two amino acid, the leaving group on the Alanine
C-terminal and on the Cystein N-terminal is outside the molecule.
</p>
<p>
Leaving group information can be set to an attachment point using the 
following methods:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> <code>SuperatomSgroup.setLeavingGroup(int order, int atNo);</code>
	<li> <code>SuperatomSgroup.setLeavingGroup(int order, int atNo, String alternativeName);</code>
	<li> <code>SuperatomSgroup.setLeavingGroup(int order, int atNo, String alternativeName, 
						BondType crossingBondType);</code>
</ul>
<p>
In the argument of these methods, the 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>order</code> 
		is order of attachment point which the leaving group is set to; </li>
	<li><code>atNo</code> 
	   	is atomic number of the leaving group atom;</li>
	<li><code>alternativeName</code> is an other name of the leaving group 
		which is possible to be set. 
		For example, the terminal leaving groups of a DNA chain may have
		alternative name 3' and 5'. By default, this string is null.</li>
	<li>The <code>crossingBondType</code> defined type of the bond connecting 
		the leaving group with its Superatom S-group. 
		This also determines the bond type of the crossing bond. 
		By default, the <code>crossingBondType</code> it is a single bond.   
		The type of this bond is allowed to be changed, 
		using method <code>MolBond.setType(int)</code>
		only when the leaving group is the molecule, that is, 
		when no crossing bond is attached. </li>
</ul>

<p>
We provide methods to obtain leaving group information in the 
<code>AttachmentPoint</code> class.
</p>
<ul>
	<li> <code>AttachmentPoint.getLeavingGroupAtom();</code> </li>
	<li> <code>AttachmentPoint.getLeavingGroupAlternativeName();</code></li>
	<li> <code>AttachmentPoint.getCrossingBondType();</code> </li>
</ul> 
<p>
The method <code>SuperatomSgroup.removeLeavingGroup(order)</code> removes the
leaving group <i>permanently</i> from the molecule.
</p>
<p>
Methods <code>Molecule.add(MolBond)</code> and <code>Molecule.removeBond()</code>
handles automatically the leaving group removal and addition to the molecule.
</p>

<h4> Embedded Superatom S-groups </h4>
<p>
In case of embedded SuperatomSgroups adding attachment point to a specific atom 
is only possible in it's smallest Superatom S-group in the S-group hierarchy. 
Assume two SuperatomSgroups: parent and child. If an atom is part of the parent and the child S-group 
as well than we will only be able to add attachment points in the child S-group to this particular atom. 
That also means that this attachment point information will only be reachable from the child SuperatomSgroup.
</p>

<h3> Expanded, contracted state </h3> 
There are two states of the molecule:
<ul>
 <li>All represented atoms are present in the parent molecule in all expandable 
  S-group independently from their expansion state.
  Here we can see a special S-group state called 
  <code>Sgroup.XSTATE_XC</code> where the 
  S-group remembers its previous contracted 
  state but the represented atoms were moved to the molecule graph 
  and the abbreviation (SgroupAtom) was removed from the molecule
  graph. Set this state on all Sgroups by calling 
  <code>Molecule.setGUIContracted(false) </code>or by calling 
  <code>Sgroup.setGUIStateRecursively(false)</code> individually on Sgroup-s. 
  Example for a typical usage is a non-GUI related API
  based calculation where we need the represented atoms in the 
  molecule graph instead of the abbreviation.
 </li>
 <li>
  Either the abbreviation (SuperAtom) or the represented atom set is 
  exclusively present depending on the state of the S-group. 
  In the case of expanded S-groups (called <code>Sgroup.XSTATE_X</code>) 
  the represented atoms are present in the parent molecule. 
  In the case of contracted S-groups (called  <code>Sgroup.XSTATE_C</code>)  
  the abbreviation (SgroupAtom) is present in the parent 
  molecule. Set this state on all Sgroups by calling 
  <code>Molecule.setGUIContracted(true)</code> or by calling 
  <code>Sgroup.setGUIStateRecursively(true)</code> individually on Sgroup-s.
 </li>
 </ul>
<p>Note:<br>
When <code>Molecule.isGUIContracted() </code>returns true and afterwards you call:
</p>

<blockquote>
 <code>
  Molecule.setGUIContracted(false); <br>
  Molecule.setGUIContracted(true);
 </code>
</blockquote>
<p>
the second <code>setGUIContracted</code> call will restore the state before 
the first <code>setGUIContracted</code> call!
</p>

<h2>Amino acid S-groups</h2>
<p>
AminoAcidSgroups are special SuperAtomSgroups to represent amino acids. The construction
of these groups are exactly the same as the SuperatomSgroups. There are two additional 
attributes - the one letter and the three letter name of the amino acid.
</p>

<h2>Repeating unit S-groups</h2>
<p>
Repeating unit S-groups are used to represent polymers and other repeating
units. 
</p> 
<p>
In order to construct a repeating unit S-group object, use its constructor as
</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
	RepeatingUnitSgroup repeatingSg = new RepeatingUnitSgroup(Molecule mol,
		String connectivity, int type); 
</pre> 
<p>The parameter <code>Molecule</code> object will be the parent of the S-group 
<code>repeatingSg</code>.
The String connectivity defines way the units connects to each other: "ht", for
head-to-tail; "hh", for head-to-head, and "eu" for either/undefined polymers.
The type of the S-group can be defined using the following constants:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>Sgroup.ST_ANY</code>,</li>
  <li> <code>Sgroup.ST_SRU</code>,</li>
  <li> <code>Sgroup.ST_COPOLYMER</code>,</li>
  <li> <code>Sgroup.ST_CROSSLINK</code>,</li>
  <li> <code>Sgroup.ST_GRAFT</code>,</li>
  <li> <code>Sgroup.ST_MODIFICATION</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Atoms and bonds can be added to a repeating unit S-group in a same way as to a
Superatom S-group.
</p>
The bracket of this type of S-groups defines the repeating fragment of the 
polymer. Bonds that cross the brackets, called crossing bonds, define how
the repeating units of the S-group connect. 
<p>
<p> The <code>generateBracketCoord</code> method of the 
<code>CleanUtil</code> class generates brackets. As parameter the S-group
and the bracket type, square or round, should be added:
</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
	CleanUtil.generateBracketCoords(repeatingSg, MBracket.T_SQUARE);
</pre>
<p>
The end groups of polymers are often unknown or unspecified which are 
represented by star atoms (*). Star atoms are defined with the </p>
<pre class="sh_java">
	repeatingSg.addStarAtoms();	
</pre>
<p>
method.
</p>
